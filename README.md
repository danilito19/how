========================

### What is how?
-------------

**how**

a little Flask pet project to calculate if it's more cost effective to live near work or live farther away and commute. 

Requirements
-----------

* You are using Python 2.7.
* you have [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)

Data
---------------
* Median rent data from [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/blog/api-for-housing-data)
* Gas prices from [mapquest](gasprices.mapquest.com). mapquest doesn't have an API for gas prices, so I did make direct API calls to its undocumented API.

Features
---------------
* options of rent or own
* cost of owning a car or commuting at the current cost of public transportation
* input address or zipcode or just click on map location
* size of home / number of b&b




Contribute
